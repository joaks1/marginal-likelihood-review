    A comparison of the true branch length separating each pair of simulated
    sequences to the branch length estimated by ABC-GLM and full-likelihood
    MCMC under the correct branch-length model (branch length ~ uniform(0.0001,
    0.1)) and the vague model (branch length ~ uniform(0.0001, 0.1)).
