    A comparison of the approximate-likelihood Baysian computation general
    linear model (ABC-GLM) estimator of the marginal likelihood
    \citep{Leuenberger2010} to quadrature integration approximations
    \citep{Xie2011} for 100 simulated datasets.
    We compared the ratio of the marginal likelihood (Bayes factor) comparing
    the correct branch-length model (branch length ~ uniform(0.0001, 0.1)) to a
    model with a broader prior (branch length ~ uniform(0.0001, 0.2)) on the
    branch length.
    The solid line represents perfect performance of the ABC-GLM estimator
    (i.e., matching the ``true'' value of the Bayes factor).
    The dashed line represents the expected Bayes factor when failing to
    penalize for the extra parameter space (branch length 0.1 to 0.2) with
    essentially zero likelihood.
    Quadrature integration with 1,000 and 10,000 steps using the rectangular
    and trapezoidal rule produced identical values to five decimal places, so
    we treat those values as the ``true'' Bayes factor.
