    A comparison of the approximate-likelihood Baysian computation general
    linear model (ABC-GLM) estimator of the marginal likelihood
    \citep{Leuenberger2010} to the full-likelihood stepping-stone approach
    \citep{Xie2011} for 100 simulated datasets.
    We ran three replicates of the stepping-stone analysis for each dataset,
    and all were within 1 likelihood unit; we use the mean value of the
    replicates in the plot.
