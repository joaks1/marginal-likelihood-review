    A comparison of the approximate-likelihood Baysian computation general
    linear model (ABC-GLM) estimator of the marginal likelihood
    \citep{Leuenberger2010} to quadrature integration approximations 
    \citep{Xie2011} for 100 simulated datasets.
    Quadrature integration with 1,000 and 10,000 steps using the rectangular
    and trapezoidal rule produced identical values to six decimal places.
